              Your introduction and credits are two of the most important
              elements of your StarNow profile. Make the most of your
              introduction by writing a short, snappy paragraph about yourself.
              Be professional and include elements of your personality in the
              text. Remember to include a link to your personal website if you
              have one. Your credits should outline your relevant experience in
              the industry and be simple to read.
